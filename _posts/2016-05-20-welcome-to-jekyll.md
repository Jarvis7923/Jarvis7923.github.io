You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isMatch(string s, string p) {
        if (p.empty()) return s.empty();
        if (p.size() == 1) {
            return (s.size() == 1 && (s[0] == p[0] || p[0] == '.'));
        }
        if (p[1] != '*') {
            if (s.empty()) return false;
            return (s[0] == p[0] || p[0] == '.') && isMatch(s.substr(1), p.substr(1));
        }
        while (!s.empty() && (s[0] == p[0] || p[0] == '.')) {
            if (isMatch(s, p.substr(2))) return true;
            s = s.substr(1);
        }
        return isMatch(s, p.substr(2));
    }
};
